# 100 - Feature-Driven Development

Based on "Feature-Driven Development" at https://github.com/KevinAst/eatery-nod-w/blob/master/README.md

## 100 - Introduction

The implementation of **eatery-nod-w** employs **features** through a utility called **[feature-u]**, that facilitates **feature-based
solutions**, making it's features truly **plug-and-play**!

**Feature Based Development** greatly improves code comprehension, because there is a direct correlation between the **problem space**
_(or requirements)_ and the **implementation** _(the code)_!

This approach scales better, making the code easier to maintain, because the modules _(or features)_ are smaller and more focused.
When features are **plug-and-play**, the application is in essence broken up into several mini-apps _(so to speak)_.

Here is a complete list of the **eatery-nod-w** [**features**](src/features/README.md) that make up the application, and
the [**plugin aspects**](src/aspects/README.md) that auto-configure the frameworks in it's run-time stack.

You can find more information about **[feature-u]** here:
